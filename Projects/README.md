## Project Structure Template

When creating new projects, consider this structure:

```
project_name/
├── README.md              # Project description and instructions
├── requirements.txt       # Project-specific dependencies
├── data/                  # Dataset and data processing scripts
├── models/                # Model definitions (can import from parent dirs)
├── training/              # Training scripts and configurations
├── evaluation/            # Evaluation and testing scripts
├── notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks for exploration
├── results/               # Saved models, logs, and outputs
└── utils/                 # Utility functions and helpers
```

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a Project**: Select from ideas above or create your own
2. **Create Directory**: Make a new folder with descriptive name
3. **Add README**: Document project goals, setup, and usage
4. **Import Models**: Use implementations from other directories
5. **Implement Pipeline**: Create end-to-end workflow
6. **Document Results**: Save outputs and analysis

## Integration with Repository

Projects should leverage existing implementations:

- **Models**: Import from `Computer Vision/`, `RNNs/`, `GPT-2/`, etc.
- **Tokenizers**: Use BPE implementations from `Tokenizers/`
- **Transformers**: Utilize transformer components from `Transformers/`
- **Papers**: Reference papers from `Papers/` directory for theoretical background

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Keep projects self-contained but reuse existing implementations
- Use relative imports to access parent directory models
- Maintain clean separation between data, models, and experiments

### Documentation
- Clear README with setup instructions
- Document any modifications to base models
- Include results and analysis
- Provide usage examples

### Reproducibility
- Pin dependency versions in requirements.txt
- Use random seeds for reproducible results
- Save model checkpoints and configurations
- Document hardware requirements

### Version Control
- Use git to track project development
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Tag important milestones and results

## Contributing

When adding projects:

1. **Follow Structure**: Use recommended project structure
2. **Document Thoroughly**: Clear README and code comments
3. **Test Code**: Ensure code runs without errors
4. **Add Dependencies**: List any new requirements
5. **Update This README**: Add your project to the list

## Examples of Complete Projects

Future projects might include:

- **MNIST Classifier Comparison**: CNN vs ViT vs MLP performance analysis
- **Shakespeare Text Generator**: GPT-2 fine-tuned on Shakespeare corpus
- **CIFAR-10 Ensemble**: Combining multiple CNN architectures
- **Custom Dataset Pipeline**: End-to-end training on user-provided data
- **Model Compression**: Techniques for reducing model size while maintaining performance

This directory provides a space to apply and combine the theoretical knowledge and implementations from other parts of the repository into practical, working applications.
